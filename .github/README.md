# Upstash Redis

An HTTP/REST based Redis client built on top of
[Upstash REST API](https://docs.upstash.com/features/restapi).

[![Tests](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis/actions/workflows/tests.yaml)
![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@upstash/redis)
![npm bundle size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@upstash/redis)

It is the only connectionless (HTTP based) Redis client and designed for:

- Serverless functions (AWS Lambda ...)
- Cloudflare Workers (see
  [the example](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis/tree/master/examples/cloudflare-workers))
- Fastly Compute@Edge (see
  [the example](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis/tree/master/examples/fastly))
- Next.js, Jamstack ...
- Client side web/mobile applications
- WebAssembly
- and other environments where HTTP is preferred over TCP.

See [the list of APIs](https://docs.upstash.com/features/restapi#rest---redis-api-compatibility) supported.

## Upgrading from v0.2.0?

Please read the [migration guide](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis#migrating-to-v1).
For further explanation we wrote a [blog post](https://blog.upstash.com/upstash-redis-sdk-v1).

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install @upstash/redis
```

### Create database

Create a new redis database on [upstash](https://console.upstash.com/)

### Environments

We support various platforms, such as nodejs, cloudflare and fastly.
Platforms differ slightly when it comes to environment variables and their `fetch` api. Please use the correct import when deploying to special platforms.

#### Node.js

Examples: Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda

If you are running on nodejs you can set `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` as environment variable and create a redis instance like this:

```ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis"

const redis = new Redis({
  url: <UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL>,
  token: <UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN>,
})

// or load directly from env
const redis = Redis.fromEnv()
```

- [Code example](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis/tree/main/examples/node)

#### Cloudflare Workers

Cloudflare handles environment variables differently than nodejs.
Please add `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` using `wrangler secret put ...` or in the cloudflare dashboard.

Afterwards you can create a redis instance:

```ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis/cloudflare"

const redis = new Redis({
  url: <UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL>,
  token: <UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN>,
})
// or load directly from env
const redis = Redis.fromEnv()
```

- [Code example](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis/tree/main/examples/cloudflare-workers)
- [Documentation](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/tutorials/cloudflare_workers_with_redis)

#### Fastly

Fastly introduces a concept called [backend](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/services/backend/). You need to configure a backend in your `fastly.toml`. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis/blob/main/examples/fastly/fastly.toml).
Until the fastly api stabilizes we recommend creating an instance manually:

```ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis/fastly"

const redis = new Redis({
  url: <UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL>,
  token: <UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN>,
  backend: <BACKEND_NAME>,
})
```

- [Code example](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis/tree/main/examples/fastly)
- [Documentation](https://blog.upstash.com/fastly-compute-edge-with-redi)

### Working with types

Most commands allow you to provide a type to make working with typescript easier.

```ts
const data = await redis.get<MyCustomType>("key")
// data is typed as `MyCustomType`
```

## Migrating to v1

### Explicit authentication

The library is no longer automatically trying to load connection secrets from environment variables.
You must either supply them yourself:

```ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis"

const redis = new Redis({
  url: <UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL>,
  token: <UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN>,
})
```

Or use one of the static constructors to load from environment variables:

```ts
// Nodejs
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis"
const redis = Redis.fromEnv()
```

```ts
// or when deploying to cloudflare workers
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis/cloudflare"
const redis = Redis.fromEnv()
```

### Error handling

Errors are now thrown automatically instead of being returned to you.

```ts
// old
const { data, error } = await set("key", "value")
if (error) {
  throw new Error(error)
}

// new
const data = await redis.set("key", "value") // error is thrown automatically
```

## Pipeline

`v1.0.0` introduces redis pipelines.
Pipelining commands allows you to send a single http request with multiple commands.

```ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis"

const redis = new Redis({
  /* auth */
})

const p = redis.pipeline()

// Now you can chain multiple commands to create your pipeline:

p.set("key", 2)
p.incr("key")

// or inline:
p.hset("key2", "field", { hello: "world" }).hvals("key2")

// Execute the pipeline once you are done building it:
// `exec` returns an array where each element represents the response of a command in the pipeline.
// You can optionally provide a type like this to get a typed response.
const res = await p.exec<[Type1, Type2, Type3]>()
```

For more information about pipelines using REST see [here](https://blog.upstash.com/pipeline).

### Advanced

A low level `Command` class can be imported from `@upstash/redis` in case you need more control about types and or (de)serialization.

By default all objects you are storing in redis are serialized using `JSON.stringify` and recursively deserialized as well. Here's an example how you could customize that behaviour. Keep in mind that you need to provide a `fetch` polyfill if you are running on nodejs. We recommend [isomorphic-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-fetch).

```ts
import { Command } from "@upstash/redis/commands"
import { HttpClient } from "@upstash/redis/http"

/**
 * TData represents what the user will enter or receive,
 * TResult is the raw data returned from upstash, which may need to be
 * transformed or parsed.
 */
const deserialize: (raw: TResult) => TData = ...

class CustomGetCommand<TData, TResult> extends Command<TData | null, TResult | null> {
  constructor(key: string, ) {
    super(["get", key], { deserialize })
  }
}

const client = new HttpClient({
  baseUrl: <UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL>,
  headers: {
    authorization: `Bearer ${<UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN>}`,
  },
})

const res = new CustomGetCommand("key").exec(client)

```

#### Javascript MAX_SAFE_INTEGER

Javascript can not handle numbers larger than `2^53 -1` safely and would return wrong results when trying to deserialize them.
In these cases the default deserializer will return them as string instead. This might cause a mismatch with your custom types.

```ts
await redis.set("key", "101600000000150081467")
const res = await redis<number>("get")
```

In this example `res` will still be a string despite the type annotation.
Please keep that in mind and adjust accordingly.
