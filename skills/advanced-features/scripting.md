# Lua Scripting

## What This File Covers

- EVAL, EVALSHA for executing Lua scripts
- Writing Lua scripts for complex operations
- Script caching and optimization
- Accessing Redis commands from Lua
- Atomic operations with scripts
- Common patterns: rate limiting, complex updates
- Debugging Lua scripts

## Key Topics

1. **Basic Scripting**: EVAL with simple Lua scripts
2. **Script Caching**: EVALSHA for performance
3. **Atomic Operations**: Complex logic executed atomically
4. **Redis Commands**: Calling Redis from Lua (redis.call)
5. **Arguments**: Passing keys and values to scripts
6. **Use Cases**: Rate limiting, conditional updates, atomic workflows
7. **Best Practices**: Script optimization, error handling
